# Encrypted Logistic Regression
It is addition of another machine leanring algorithm to my effort to convert these with fully homomorphic encryption. 
This is a lot simpler because this is a little step helping in moving towards deep learning models.
I have not put much effort on it like CNN so it is not that well optimized.

Encrypted prediction model is at branch https://github.com/Arman001/LogisticRegression/tree/encrypted_logistic_regression
